# No No Bananas 

## Description
### **No No Bananas** is based on a slot machine game, but with a little twist. Matching fruits will give points, with the excpetion of the **Rotten Banana**.
### I created this game with an **8-bit art style**, because the 1st generation pokemon games were a big part of my childhood and still influence me to this day.

## Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Getting Started: 

### This game is optimized for monitors with a screen resolution of 1440p(QHD).
### It is **highy recommended** for players with a lower screen resolution to zoom-out using ctrl + mousewheel until all the elements fit in the screen for optimal visual experience.

### Player must obtain the same fruit in all 3 slots to gain coins. The amount of coins obtained will vary based on the type of fruit: 
 1. “Fresh Avocado” x 3 = +30 coins 
 2. “Happy Watermelon” x 3 = +15 coins 
 3. “Sweet Strawberry” x 3 = +10 coins 
 4. “Rotten Banana” x 3 = -10 coins 

### Player always starts with 20 coins.
### Player loses 1 coin per turn if the fruits do not match up. 

## Game will end if one of the following conditions are met: 
### Player score is greater than or equal to 35 coins. Player's name will appear under "Fruit Challengers" (win) 
### Player score is less than or equal to 0 coins. Player's name will appear under "Fruit Noobs" (loss) 
### Player clicks on the "New Game" button.

## Icebox 
### Add weighted probability, so fruits won't have equal chances of being picked. This could potentially help scoring matching fruits more easily. 
### Add a spinning animation to each slot after hitting the "spin" button, to closely mimic a traditional slot machine.
### Add a legitimate "high score" section that would actually store data in a server.

## Rules/Guidelines

### This game is optimized for monitors with a screen resolution of 1440p(QHD).
### It is recommended for players with a lower screen resolution the "zoom-out" function with ctrl + mousewheel for optimal visual experience.

## Gameplay

### Player must obtain the same fruit in all 3 slots to gain coins. The amount of coins obtained will vary based on the type of fruit: 
#### “Fresh Avocado” x 3 = +30 coins 
#### “Happy Watermelon” x 3 = +15 coins 
#### “Sweet Strawberry” x 3 = +10 coins 
#### “Rotten Banana” x 3 = -10 coins 

### Player always starts with 20 coins.
### Player loses 1 coin per turn if the fruits do not match up. 

## Game will end if one of the following conditions are met: 
### Player score is greater than or equal to 35 coins. (win) 
### Player score is less than or equal to 0 coins. (loss) 
### Player clicks on the "New Game" button.

## Icebox 
### Add weighted probability, so fruits won't have equal chances of being picked. This could potentially help scoring matching fruits more easily. 
### Add a spinning animation to each slot after hitting the "spin" button, to closely mimic a traditional slot machine.
### Add a legitimate "high score" section that would actually store data in a server.
